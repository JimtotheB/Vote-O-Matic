## Then the new..
# Reddit Vote-O-Matic
### may just be for you.

####The Reddit Vote-O-matic is a GreaseMonkey/Tampermonkey script to handle up/down voting all of your favorite accounts.

##### Simple to use
* Just drop into your script manager.
* Adding users is simple - Just hover over a username and click the group they belong to, goodguys or badguys.
* Or just add them to the goodGuys/badGuys array at the top of the script.

##### Unobtrusive
* Never forget to upvote your friends again.
* Vote-O-Matic silently chugs along voting every .5 - 2 seconds until the list is exausted.

##### Cutting edge Shoehorn™* based GUI
* Lists comment counts and votes left for all of your selected users.
* Hover over a listed user to delete or visit their page.
* Spruces up your Reddit experience by making orange and perrywinkle arrows appear, like MAGIC.

## Roadmap
* 0.0.1 - You are looking at it.
* 0.0.2 - Add vote all buttons to user hover. Currently need to add them and delete them for the same effect.
* 0.0.3? - Firefox/Chrome extensions.

*Shoehorn™ GUI not guaranteed to work, look good, or even function, on a subreddit without default styling.
Even then, no guarantees.
